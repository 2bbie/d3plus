The following blog post will walk you through how to get up and running with the absolute basics of creating a D3plus visualization. We will start by looking at how and where to download the library, formatting data and lastly creating a tree map from scratch.

When developing locally, note that your browser may enforce strict permissions for reading files out of the local file system. If you use d3.xhr locally (including d3.json et al.), you must have a local web server. For example, you can run Python's built-in server:

{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
function code_example_with_javascript_syntax_highlights() {
  console.log("Showing the syntax highlighting rendering of code using gh-pages-blog.");
}
{% endhighlight %}
