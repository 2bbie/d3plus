title: Building a Pie Scatter

<h2 class="bar">Scatter Plots of Nested Data</h2>
<section>
  <p>
    Sometimes the best way of comparing two different attributes of your data is to simply plot them on an X, Y plane. Visually, large datasets can suffer from over crowding of nodes thus reducing legibility. One solution, used throughout the other visualizations is to allow nesting of nodes to get a clearer idea of the overall picture. What you sacrifice in accuracy, you gain in legibility.

  <h3>A Note on Scale</h3>
  <p>
    The only specific methods for the pie scatter visualization are <code>.xaxis_scale()</code> and <code>.yaxis_scale()</code>. If these methods are not used, they will default to linear, they can also accept the the value "log".
