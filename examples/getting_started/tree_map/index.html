  <h2>Tree Map</h2>
  <p>
    Tree Maps are a great way to show your dataset as shares of a whole. Unlike Pie Charts, which have a lot of unused white space along the edges of the visualization, Tree Maps allow for smaller data points to become much more visible because the visualization is allowed to take up the entirity of the screen space.
