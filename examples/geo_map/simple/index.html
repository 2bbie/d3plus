  <h2>Geo Map</h2>
  <p>
    An easy way to map data to locations around the world. The .id() key in your data must match the "id" key in the topojson that you import. <a href="world.json" target="_blank">Click here</a> if you would like to download the topojson we use in this example. The first 2 characters of the IDs we use represent the continent the country is on, and the final 3 characters are the ISO 3-digit country code. For example, the United States is "nausa": "na" for North America and "usa" for the country.
