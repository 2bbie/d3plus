  <h2>Stacked Area Chart</h2>
  <p>
    The Stacked Area Chart is a variation of the Chart Visualization with values drawn as areas stacked on top of one another with a continuous x-axis. This visualization allows a quick assessment of how the data breaks up by share of the whole over a specified variable, most commonly "time".
